3. Configure the TestPyPi token: `poetry config pypi-token.test-pypi <token>`
4. Grab your token from PyPi.
5. Configure the TestPyPi token: `poetry config pypi-token.pypi  <token>`

### Test and publish a new Python release with PyPi and TestPyPi

1. If TestPyPi and PyPi are not configured, follow [the corresponding guide](#configure-testpypi-and-pypi).
2. Update the version in `pyproject.toml`.
3. Build the new version: `poetry build`
4. Publish to TestPyPi: `poetry publish -r test-pypi -u <username>`
5. Install the package through TestPyPi: `pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ semgrep-rules-manager`
6. Execute your tests by leveraging the `semgrep-rules-manager` command.
7. If all your tests are passing, publish to PyPi: `poetry publish -u <username>`
8. Try to install the package from PyPi: `pip install semgrep-rules-manager`

### Publish a new Snap release

1. Change the version in `snap/snapcraft.yaml`.
2. Build the snap: `snapcraft`
3. Install the created snap: `snap install --dangerous semgrep-rules-manager_*.snap`
4. Execute your tests by leveraging the `semgrep-rules-manager` command.
5. If all your tests are passing, upload to Snapstore: `snapcraft push`

### Add a new source with Semgrep rules

1. Add a new entry in `semgrep_rules_manager/data/sources.yaml`.
2. Commit and push (eventually, through a fork) the changes.
3. Pull the `README.*` files automatically generated by the GitHub action.
